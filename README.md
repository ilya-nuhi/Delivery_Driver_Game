# Delivery_Driver_Game
This is my first unity project.   
In this game we are a delivery person who picks up the packages and transport it to the customer.

Mechanics in this game:  
When player picks up the package, package disappears and car's color change to the package's color.  
Player can only carry one package at a time.
If player pass through boost the car accelerates, if the player crashes on to something car slows down.
